def tic tac toe
    Play a tic-tac-toe game between the two given functions. After each
    turn, yield the new board.
    Each function should get a tic-tac-toe board and a char - 'X' or 'O',
    that represents the current turn, and return the number of
    square where it wants to put a sign.
    width is the board's width and length - it's 3 as default.

    X, O -- functions
    width -- natural number

def displayTicTacToe(X, O, width=3):
    """Play a tic-tac-toe game (see TicTacToe's docstring for explanation) and
    display the new board to the user when a player plays, and the result of
    the game after its end.

    X, O - functions
    width - natural number"""

def result(board):
    """Return 'X' if X won in the given board, 'O' if O won, None if the game
    ended with a tie, False if the game didn't end yet, and raise an exception
    if it looks like X and O won both (the board cannot be reached using a
    legal game)."""

    turn, and return a tuple of the square's number and it's score according
    to the minimax algorithm."""

"""Return 1, 0 or -1 according to the minimax algorithm -- 1 if the player
    that has the given turn has a winning strategy, 0 if he doesn't have a
    winning strategy but he has a tie strategy, and -1 if he will lose anyway
    (assuming his opponent is playing a perfect game)."""
